    "Then, the `system_message` variable below needs to **STRICTLY** include the following: \"You are an assistant with access to specific tools.

For the {'corresponding'} tool, provide the {user message} as a string into the {'user message'} argument in the tool or any {'predefined values'} as a string for other arguments in the tool.\"\n",

    "For eg. for the 'calculator' tool, since the function for the 'calculator' tool above has one argument called 'expression', the `system_message` variable below would need to look like \"You are a math expert. You are an assistant with access to specific tools. When the user's question requires a calculation, use the 'calculator' tool. For the 'calculator' tool, provide the user provided math expression as a string into the 'expression' argument in the tool.\"\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I should start by directly answering the question. The user wants the product of 123 and 456. The answer is 56,088. But how to phrase it naturally?\n",

      "Maybe start with \"The product of 123 and 456 is 56,088.\" That's straightforward. But maybe make it a bit more conversational. \"Multiplying 123 by 456 gives 56,088.\" That sounds good. Ensure that the numbers are correctly formatted, maybe with a comma for thousands separator. The tool result was 56088, so writing it as 56,088 is correct.\n",

So perhaps just the answer with a simple sentence. \"The result of 123 multiplied by 456 is 56,088.\" Or even shorter: \"123 multiplied by 456 equals 56,088.\" Yes, that's concise. No need for extra words. Just state the equation and the result. Check if the numbers are right. 123 times 456. Let me verify quickly. 123*400=49,200, 123*50=6,150, 123*6=738. Adding those: 49,200 + 6,150 = 55,350 + 738 = 56,088. Yep, matches the tool result. So the answer is correct. Alright, that should do it.\n",

Maybe start with \"There are 7 words...\" and include the sentence in quotes. Also, confirm that \"1st\" is considered part of the count. Alternatively, maybe the user is testing if \"Hello World\" as two separate words is counted correctly. The tool counted them as two, which is right. So everything checks out.

Maybe start with \"The product of 123 and 456 is 56,088.\" That's direct and concise. Should I add anything else? Maybe mention it's the result, but the user just wants the answer.

But the generally accepted approximate number is around 7,000. However, I can't just rely on memory; maybe I should check if there's a tool for this. Wait, the user said to use the tools when applicable. But looking at the tools available: there's a calculator and a text_analyzer. The calculator is for math expressions, and the text_analyzer counts words or characters in a given text. The user's question isn't providing any text to analyze, nor is it a math problem.\n",

Since the tools can't be used for this question, I should answer directly. Therefore, the answer would be that there are approximately 7,000 languages, but I should mention that the exact number is debated.
